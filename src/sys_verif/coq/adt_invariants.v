### Invariant-based ADT specification

An ADT consists of:

- A type `T` (the _code_ or _concrete_ representation) of the data type.
- Initialization (constructors or "introduction"). For some `A: Type`, `init: A → T`
- Methods: for some `A: Type`, `op: T → A → T`
- Getters ("eliminators"): of the form `f: T → A` for some `A: Type`.

Exactly as before, we first need a model of the ADT we want to prove it against:

1. Create a model with `S: Type`, `init_spec : A → S`, `op_spec : S → A → S`,
   and `f_spec : S → A`.

The difference is how we connect the ADT code to the model:

2. Pick an abstraction function `rep : T → S` and also pick an invariant `inv :
   T → Prop`.
3. Prove the following obligations for each function:
    - For `init_spec : A → S`, prove `∀ (v: A), rep (init v) = init_spec v` AND `∀ v, inv (init v)`.
    - For `op_spec : S → A → S`, prove `∀ (x: T) (v: A), inv x → rep (op x v) =
      op_spec (rep x) v ∧ inv (op x v)`.
    - For `f_spec: S → A`, prove `∀ (x: T), inv x → f x = f_spec (rep x)`.

First, observe how these obligations prove that any value `y: T` produced from
using this interface will satisfy `inv y` - this is what it means for it to be
an "invariant".

Second, notice that we get to assume `inv x` as a premise, which is what makes
this more powerful, but we're also on the hook to prove `inv x` is actually
initially true and maintained (to justify assuming it). Invariants are tricky to
come up with for this reason. However, without the ability to use an invariant,
these obligations require reasoning about any value of type `T`, which may just
be impossible

Finally, a small observation: the specification style is _strictly_ more
powerful than without invariants; we can always pick `inv x = True` and then
it's the same as if we didn't have an invariant at all, but there are examples
an ADT and an associated model that we can prove are related only with
invariants.

### Exercise: re-do client-centric reasoning with invariants

- $T : \mathrm{Type}$
- $i : T$
- $op_1 : T \to T$ and $op_2 : T \to T$
- $f : T \to A$

And the spec:

- $S : \mathrm{Type}$, $rep : T \to S$, and $inv : T \to \mathrm{Prop}$
- $i' : S$
- $op_1' : S \to S$ and $op_2' : S \to S$
- $f' : S \to A$

Prove that $f' (op_2' (op_1'(i'))) = f (op_2 (op_1 (i)))$ using the theorems
above. (Note we typically write $f(x)$ for blackboard/on-paper reasoning on the
blackboard/paper while the same function application is written `f x` in Coq).

(*| :::: important What is the "specification"?

Sometimes the word "specification" refers just to the abstract model of some
code. Other times, it refers to the whole theorem that relates the code to the
abstract model. You should try to keep these concept distinct in your mind even
if you see the word used for either meaning.

We've seen only one type of abstract model, but two specification styles for
relating the code to the abstract model - the one with invariants is strictly
more general, so that's the one you should keep in mind. Later, we'll start
doing verification where the code will no longer be a functional program and
will need to revisit the connection and state a new specification theorem.

(*| This example's proofs illustrate use of the `gset` type from std++. In the
future we won't go over its implementation at all (it's fairly complicated), but
will use it to write specifications. Sets are nice in that we get the quite
powerful `set_solver` automation; it's not quite as magical as `lia` but still
fairly powerful.

On a first pass you can read this example ignoring the proofs - just read the
code, abstraction function, invariant, and spec _theorem statements_.

happens to be the easiest way in this case to find all the elements in the
left and right subtrees. |*)

(*| Look at the specifications below to see how we incorporate the invariant.

It has two goals, one about the new abstract state, and the other showing the
invariant is preserved: in both cases we can assume `st_inv t` from the previous
operation, specifically because (1) the invariant starts out true for every
constructor, and (2) every operation comes with a proof that the invariant is
preserved.

(*| The invariant is crucially needed to prove that `find` is correct - a binary

## Invariant vs non-invariant spec styles

A specification has two sides: the perspective of the implementor proving it, in
which case it's an _obligation_, and the perspective of the client using it, in
which case it's an _assumption_. In general the implementor wants
(a) true obligations (they can't prove something false) and (b) simple
obligations (if possible, they want to prove something easier than something
harder). The client wants (a) strong enough to reason about their own code, and
(b) easy-to-use specifications are preferred to strong but hard-to-understand
ones.

There is a tension here that the abstract spec is trying to balance.

When we add invariants to the model-based specification, the benefit is that it
allows us to prove _more ADTs correct_, and in fact many ADTs are only correct
because they maintain some internal invariant (the implementor now has a hope of
proving their code against this specification, like in the search tree example).
There's no cost to the client, either, since essentially the same client
reasoning works regardless of what the invariant is.

|*)

(*| 
### Alternative specification: equational specifications

A completely different style than the above is to give _equational_ or
_algebraic_ specifications. An example where this makes a lot of sense is
`encode`/`decode` functions. The main property we generally want of such
functions (as a _client_ or user of such code) is a "round trip" theorem that
says `∀ x, decode (encode x) = x`. There isn't even an obvious "model" to
describe encoding or decoding.

The danger of equational or algebraic specifications is that it's harder to
think about whether the specification is good enough for client reasoning - in
general need to give specs for any combination of functions. It has the
advantage of not requiring an abstraction.

|*)

(*| ### Equational spec for maps |*)

(*| Here is an ADT implementing maps that we'll prove equational properties
for, rather than relating it to `gmap`. Think of this as what you would do if
_implementing_ `gmap`, except we'll discuss later how `gmap` has a more
complicated implementation to make it easier to use. |*)

Definition list_map (K: Type) {H: EqDecision K} (V: Type) :=
  list (K * V).

(*| Sections are a way of writing a bunch of definitions that need to take the
same types, like the `K`, `H: EqDecision K`, and `V` parameters for `list_map`.
|*)
Section list_map.

(* To understand the code below, all you need to know is that `K` and `V` are
defined as arbitrary types by this `Context` command. When the section is
closed, all of these will become arguments to the definitions in the section for
any users of this code (and there are no users yet for this little example). *)
Context {K: Type} {H: EqDecision K} {V: Type}.

Definition empty_list_map : list_map K V := [].

Fixpoint find (x: K) (m: list_map K V) : option V :=
  match m with
  | [] => None
  | (x', v) :: m' => if decide (x = x') then Some v else find x m'
  end.

Definition update (x : K) (v: V) (m: list_map K V) : list_map K V :=
  (x, v) :: m.

(*| What equations might we want? One idea is that we should prove something
about any combinations of `find` and `update` we can think of (that type check).
|*)

Lemma find_empty_list_map x :
  find x empty_list_map = None.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Lemma find_update_eq (m: list_map K V) x v :
  find x (update x v m) = Some v.
Proof.
  rewrite /update. simpl.
  rewrite -> decide_True by auto.
  reflexivity.

Lemma find_update_neq (m: list_map K V) x y o :
  x ≠ y → find x (update y o m) = find x m.
Proof.
  intros Hne.
  rewrite /update. simpl.
  rewrite -> decide_False by auto.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(*| At this point, have we proven all the equations that might be needed? I
believe so, but it's hard to be sure, and the situation is worse when we have
many operations that can interact with each other. |*)

End list_map.

(*| ## Extension 2: abstraction relations {#abstraction-relations}

There's one more extension beyond invariants that allows us to verify even more
examples. Instead of an abstraction function `abs : T → S`, we can instead have
an **abstraction relation** `abs_rel : T → S → Prop`, which you can think of as
answering for each `T`, what are the possible values of `S` that could be the
current abstract state? There might not be _any_ values of `S`, which
corresponds to a `T` that doesn't satisfy the invariant, or there might be one
unique one like we had before with the abstraction function.

One reason you would want this is that the most obvious specification or model
has more information than the code actually tracks. For an example, consider a
"statistics database" that tracks the running sum and number of elements as
elements are added and is able to report the mean of the elements added so far
(this example is implemented and verified below). In the model, we would track
all the elements. But then there's no function from the code state to the spec:
the code intentionally forgets information, but it can still answer what the
mean is at any time. This example is nonetheless provable with an abstraction
relation.

Another direction you might want to think about how we could add non-determinism
to both the code operations and the spec operations, although this will take us
away from functional programs so we won't consider it just yet.
